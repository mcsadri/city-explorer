## Lab 06

### Tasks & User Stories 06

1. Set up your React repository & API keys.
2. Locations: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.
3. Map: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.
4. Errors: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
