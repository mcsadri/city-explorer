## Overview

City Explorer is a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for information for any city in the world from a third-party API, then render the API response(s) on screen for the user.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

### Tasks & User Stories 06

1. Set up your React repository & API keys.
2. Locations: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.
3. Map: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.
4. Errors: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
